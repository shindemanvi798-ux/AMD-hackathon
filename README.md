💧 AI Water Crisis Predictor An intelligent water management system that uses Machine Learning to predict daily water demand, detect abnormal usage (leakage risk), and provide smart recommendations for sustainable urban water distribution. This project simulates real-world urban water challenges and provides a scalable solution for Smart Cities.

🚀 Problem Statement Urban areas face: Water shortages Pipeline leakages Poor demand planning Uneven water distribution Manual monitoring leads to wastage and inefficiency.

Our solution uses AI to: Forecast water demand Detect abnormal spikes Suggest corrective actions

🧠 Features 📊 Daily Water Demand Prediction 📈 7-Day Forecast 🚨 Leakage Risk Detection (Low / Medium / High) 💡 Smart Recommendation Engine 🌍 Multi-Area Support 🔗 REST API Backend (Flask)

🔮 Future Scope Integration with IoT water sensors Real-time municipal dashboard Government water department integration Smart City expansion
